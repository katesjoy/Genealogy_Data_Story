Data compiled for a data story on the searchability of genealogy records.
Source websites mined for data. Source websites are listed against mined numbers in the CSV file for verification. All source data was entered on 22 February 2026.
FamilySearch data is for personal use only. As per their website, their data can't be used for commercial purposes.
Family search total value units are billions.
The displayed data has been abbreviated and rounded in the e-poster/infographic data story. However, the graphs were made with the full data in the CSV file within Excel.
FamilySearch changed the way it added and recorded digital records in 2021 and 2022 so earlier data was not utilised in the graph.
A stable source for earlier Trove dashboard figures could not be identified. It's possible with access to a Trove API key this could be found. However, a key was not granted in time for this assignment.
For Trove: Total number of Trove articles = total number of digitised newspaper articles in Trove.
For FamilySearch data: Searchable names = the number of searchable names in FamilySearch digitised historical records; Digital images = the number of digital images that FamilySearch have published.
